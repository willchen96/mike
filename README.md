Mike (MikeOSS) is an open-source legal AI platform for document review,
drafting, and legal research.

It combines a Next.js frontend, an Express backend, Supabase Auth/Postgres,
and Cloudflare R2-compatible object storage.

## Features

- Chat with legal documents and open matters
- Review documents and apply suggested edits
- Run reusable assistant and tabular-review workflows
- Organize projects, folders, and a document library
- Verify citations and research US case law with CourtListener
- Work from Microsoft Word with the beta task-pane add-in
- Run supported language models locally through Ollama
- Configure deployment-managed models through an OpenAI-compatible gateway (LiteLLM, Bifrost, or Portkey); see [gateway setup](docs/deployment.md#openai-compatible-gateway)

## Quick start

The included Docker Compose stack runs Mike, Supabase, RustFS object storage,
and local email capture without requiring managed infrastructure.

1. Copy the local environment templates:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. In `backend/.env`, set `DOWNLOAD_SIGNING_SECRET` and
   `USER_API_KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to separate values generated with:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

3. Add an Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI API key to `backend/.env`, unless you
   plan to use Ollama or an unauthenticated local gateway exclusively.

4. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create an account.

The bundled credentials and infrastructure are intended for local development
only. See [Local development](docs/local-development.md) for service endpoints,
authentication behavior, Ollama setup, and first-run guidance.
